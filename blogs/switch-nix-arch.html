          My Failed Switch to NixOS, or Why I Still Live in Chaos on Arch

          A 538-Day Love Affair with the Bleeding Edge
        </h2>

        <p>
          I once told someone,
          <span class="italic"
            >"Nix is for stability. I live in organized chaos."</span
          >
          I didn't realize how true that was until I tried to leave.
        </p>

        <p>
          I gave NixOS a real shot. The promises of perfect reproducibility,
          declarative configurations, and atomic upgrades whispered sweet
          nothings in my ear. On paper, it's the endgame—a system as a pristine,
          version-controlled artifact. A
          <strong class="text-sky-400">monument</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But my computer isn't a monument. It’s a
          <strong class="text-sky-400">lab</strong>. And in my lab, things
          explode.

          The Frictionless Playground
        </h3>
        <p>
          An idea strikes at 10 PM. A cool new CLI tool is trending on GitHub.
          My hands are on the keyboard, and the thought process is simple:
          <em>I want to try that. Now.</em>
        </p>

        <p>On Arch, it’s a heartbeat:</p>
        <pre
          class="bg-gray-800 text-sm p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto text-sky-300 border border-gray-700"
        ><code>yay -S some-cool-package</code></pre>

        <p>
          Five minutes later, I’m running it. Maybe it’s brilliant. Maybe it’s
          useless. Ten minutes after that, I’ve satisfied my curiosity, and it’s
          gone.
        </p>
        <pre
          class="bg-gray-800 text-sm p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto text-sky-300 border border-gray-700"
        ><code>sudo pacman -Rns some-cool-package</code></pre>

        <p>
          It vanishes. No trace, no configuration to roll back, no “generation”
          to manage. The experiment is over. My system didn’t just allow it; it
          got out of the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my workflow. A constant, churning cycle of discovery and
          destruction. I don't want my system to remember my fleeting whims. I
          want it to be a blank canvas, ready for the next chaotic splash of
          paint tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>
          With Nix, I pictured that same 10 PM spark of curiosity, but instead
          of a quick command, I saw myself editing
          <code class="text-sky-300">configuration.nix</code>, adding a package,
          and patiently waiting for the system to rebuild itself. The process,
          designed for ultimate safety, felt like a cage around my curiosity.

          Why Arch Still Feels Like Home
        </h3>
        <p>
          There’s a reason I’ve lasted 538 days on a single Arch install without
          a reinstall. It’s not because it never breaks. It’s because the
          philosophy fits me like a glove.

            >
            I like the thrill of a
            <code class="text-sky-300">pacman -Syu</code> and seeing hundreds of
            packages update. It's a direct connection to the living, breathing
            world of open source.

            <strong class="text-white">The AUR is My Candy Shop:</strong> If a
            piece of software exists and can be compiled, I can try it in
            minutes. It’s the world’s most exciting, chaotic, and functional
            repository.

          <li>
            <strong class="text-white">Fixing is the Fun:</strong> The moments
            I’ve learned the most are when a bad config or a weird update breaks
            something. I don’t want guardrails. The process of digging in,
            understanding the problem, and fixing it myself is the whole point.
            It’s how the system becomes <em>mine</em>.

          My setup is absurdly simple: <code class="text-sky-300">/</code>,
          <code class="text-sky-300">/home</code>, and a mount for my Windows
          partition. My cleanup crew is
          <code class="text-sky-300">pacman -Qdtq</code>, wiping away orphaned
          packages. It's a lean, mean, experimental machine.

          A System for Play, Not for Posterity
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let’s be honest about my use case. I’m not running critical
          infrastructure. I am:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
          <li>
            Endlessly tweaking my own
            <a
              href="https://github.com/a-lucas/uwu.vim"
              target="_blank"
              class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
              >Neovim colorscheme (uwunified)</a

          <li>
            Building a random Go CLI to update DuckDNS because it sounded fun.
          </li>
          <li>
            Patching <code class="text-sky-300">dwm</code> on a whim to see if I
            can make the bar look different.
          </li>
          <li>Trying a new password manager every other week.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          NixOS would look at this behavior and, rightly, try to protect me from
          myself. Arch just holds my beer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I respect Nix. I admire its engineering. If I managed a fleet of
          servers or a team of developers where consistency was king, I’d be its
          biggest champion. But I’m not chasing a perfect, immutable system.

          I’m chasing frictionless curiosity.

        <p>And for that, Arch Linux is still home.</p>
